# Does climate deviation can predict if restoration of terrestrial ecosystems will be successful? 

Summary: In this study I want to analyze if climate deviation has an effect in the restoration of terrestrial ecosystems.  If climatic conditions have deviated from the climate normal values in which the restoration goals were established, the conditions for successful restoration might not exist in the same way as before. The use of existing or past reference ecosystems as restoration targets could fail in predicting how an ecosystem would respond ecologically to a certain restoration action (Millar & Woolfenden, 1999). In this sense if there is a relationship between climate deviation and recovery completeness and/or recovery rate, consideration of climatic conditions previous to restoration activities could potentially help establish restoration priorities.  


## 1. Intro

### Research objectives

### Expected results

Increasing climate deviation from climate normal values in a site will result in less successful restoration. This will also be affected by the type of biome 
where restoration occurred, the type of metric used to evaluate restoration success, and the climatic factor analysed. 

## 2. Methods

### Data collection

1: Gather studies in terrestrial ecosystems evaluating restoration. Filter parameters: year restoration started, year restoration ended/was evaluated, geographical coordinates, quantitative restoration outcome. Initial period: 1913-2013. Second round 2014-2020. 

2: Calculate response ratios (recovery completeness and recovery rate) for each of the new studies included in the database

3: Gather climate normal values for each observation

Parameters: Climate normals were designated on a study by study basis. According to the year when the restoration started, the closest 
climate normal period was chosen to be compared against the climate normal posterior to restoration measurement end date. For example if 
restoration started in 1993, the climate normal period chosen as previous to restoration was 1961-1990; if restoration started in 1998, the 
climate normal period chosen was 1971-2000. 

4: Gather climate annual average for each year during which the restoration took place

5: Calculate climate deviation value for each climatic metric included

6: Create database for analysis in R (add example of how would it look like)

### Statistical analysis

1. Data exploration using???? Analyze by biome, ecosystem type, climate metric used, restoration metric used, number of years restoration lasted, period when restoration took place

2. Significance tests

If there are groups clearly formed, test. Test effect using linear mixed regression models?
