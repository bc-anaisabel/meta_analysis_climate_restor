### Data collection

Parameters: Climate normals were designated on a study by study basis. According to the year when the restoration started, the closest 
climate normal period was chosen to be compared against the climate normal posterior to restoration measurement end date. For example if 
restoration started in 1993, the climate normal period chosen as previous to restoration was 1961-1990; if restoration started in 1998, the 
climate normal period chosen was 1971-2000.
