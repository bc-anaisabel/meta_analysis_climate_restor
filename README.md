# Does climate deviation can predict if restoration of terrestrial ecosystems will be successful? 

In this study I want to analyze if **climate deviation** has an effect in the **restoration** of terrestrial ecosystems.  If climatic conditions have deviated from the climate normal values during which the restoration goals were established, the conditions for successful restoration of the ecosystem might not exist in the same way as before. In this sense, considering changes in recent climatic conditions when developing management plans and establishing restoration targets could help identify restoration priorities. Those sites where the conditions have deviated from normal values could either adjust their targets or active restoration efforts could be better directed to less altered ecosystems. 


## 1. Intro

Altered responses to restoration in an ecosystem because changed climatic conditions may create different ecological paths than those planned for with previous restoration goals (Millar & Woolfenden, 1999).

Mention: 
How restoration targets are defined
Why does it matter what we consider successful restoration in terms of funding 
Why would a changed climate affect restoration - ecological responses of an ecosystem
What is usually considered in restoration
The importance of having the year where the restoration started and when it was finally measured
Mention rate and recovery completeness


### Research objectives

Establish restoration success for studies from 2013-2020
Analyze climate deviation across sites and years
Assess if there is a relationship between climate departure from normals and restoration success

### Expected results

Increasing climate deviation from climate normal values in a site will result in less successful restoration. This will also be affected by the type of biome 
where restoration occurred, the type of metric used to evaluate restoration success, and the climatic factor analyzed. 

## 2. Methods

### Data collection

1: Gather studies in terrestrial ecosystems evaluating restoration. Filter parameters: year restoration started, year restoration ended/was evaluated, geographical coordinates, quantitative restoration outcome. Initial period: 1913-2013. Second round 2014-2020. 

2: Calculate response ratios (recovery completeness and recovery rate) for each of the new studies included in the database

3: Gather climate normal values for each observation

Parameters: Climate normals were designated on a study by study basis. According to the year when the restoration started, the closest 
climate normal period was chosen to be compared against the climate normal posterior to restoration measurement end date. For example if 
restoration started in 1993, the climate normal period chosen as previous to restoration was 1961-1990; if restoration started in 1998, the 
climate normal period chosen was 1971-2000. 

4: Gather climate annual average for each year during which the restoration took place

5: Calculate climate deviation value for each climatic metric included

6: Create database for analysis in R (add example of how would it look like)

### Statistical analysis

1. Data exploration using???? Analyze by biome, ecosystem type, climate metric used, restoration metric used, number of years restoration lasted, period when restoration took place

2. Significance tests

If there are groups clearly formed, test. Test effect using linear mixed regression models?
